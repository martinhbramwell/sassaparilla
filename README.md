# sassaparilla
This is a Meteor version of the responsive web site starter kit : [Sassaparilla ](https://github.com/fffunction/sassaparilla/blob/master/README.md#sassaparilla)

The main advantage of Sassaparilla is that you get a professionally developed responsive web site as your starting point.  Since it uses SASS and Compass from the get go, you start from a readily adaptable platform that uses best practice patterns.

I have rearranged it so that it fits with the "automatic" features of Meteor, eg. images in _public_ directory.

### Installation

 1. git clone [git@github.com:martinhbramwell/sassaparilla.git](git@github.com:martinhbramwell/sassaparilla.git)
 2. cd sassaparilla
 3. EITHER : meteor

    OR : edit the MONGO_URL in qrun.sh to point to your neighbourhood Mongo server then run _./qrun.sh_  (if you don't want to lose 100s of MBs for an empty Mongo database)

 4. Open the URL  http://localhost:3000/demo.html
